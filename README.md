# Obesity Level Prediction with Neural Networks

## Project Description
This project implements a neural network to predict an individualâ€™s obesity category using demographic, lifestyle, and physical attributes. The model classifies individuals into 7 obesity levels and achieves high accuracy, demonstrating how deep learning can aid early detection and lifestyle intervention planning.

## Skills & Tools
**Skills:** Neural network design, data preprocessing, model evaluation  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

## Dataset
The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains 2,111 samples with demographic, lifestyle, and physical features relevant to obesity classification.

## Installation
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/obesity-level-prediction.git
cd obesity-level-prediction
```
2. Install required Python packages:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook obesity_nn.ipynb
```

Alternatively, the notebook can be run directly in Google Colab.
